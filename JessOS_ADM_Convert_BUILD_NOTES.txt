JessOS ADM Convert - Build & Deployment Notes
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
JessOS ADM Convert is a modernized replacement for Apple's original "Apple
Digital Masters Droplet" tool. It converts WAV and AIFF audio files to AAC
(.m4a) format using Apple's afconvert with Apple Digital Masters encoding
parameters (256kbps AAC, SoundCheck loudness normalization).

A single app with configurable options (right-click dock icon):
  - "Include SoundCheck Metadata" (full ADM compliance)
  - "Exclude SoundCheck Metadata (Fast)" (single-pass, faster)
  - "Output to M4A Folder" (organize output files in subfolder)


IMPROVEMENTS OVER APPLE'S ORIGINAL DROPLET
------------------------------------------
1. Apple Silicon Native
   - Runs natively on ARM64 (M1/M2/M3/M4 chips)
   - No Rosetta 2 emulation required
   - Original Apple droplet was x86_64/i386 only

2. Parallel Processing
   - Converts up to 12 files simultaneously (configurable)
   - Dramatically faster batch processing on multi-core Macs
   - Original processed files sequentially (one at a time)

3. Silent Operation
   - No popup dialogs or alerts
   - Clean, minimal progress window
   - Original had multiple alert dialogs

4. Modern Progress UI
   - Native Swift/AppKit progress window
   - Shows current file being processed
   - Purple-tinted progress bar
   - Displays conversion count in real-time

5. Streaming Architecture
   - Begins processing immediately as files are discovered
   - No waiting for full file list before starting
   - Shows activity within ~0.5 seconds of drop

6. Optimized Temp File Handling
   - CAF intermediates stored in /tmp/JessOS_ADM_Convert/
   - Automatic cleanup after conversion
   - Leverages macOS disk caching for speed

7. Network Drive Support
   - Works with files on mounted network volumes
   - No path or permission issues

8. Duplicate File Handling
   - Automatically appends -1, -2, etc. if output file exists
   - Never overwrites existing files

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 3.1 - 2026-02-12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyze Only Mode

New Features:
  [+] "Analyze Only" button — check for clipping without saving M4A files
  [+] Two action buttons when WAV/AIFF files are loaded:
      - "Analyze Only" — converts to temp, runs afclip analysis, deletes temp
      - "Convert & Analyze" — existing behavior (saves M4A + analyzes)
  [+] Drop zone now shows "WAV, AIFF, M4A supported"

Architecture:
  [+] ProcessingMode enum (.convertAndAnalyze | .analyzeOnly)
  [+] Shared convertTwoPass method eliminates code duplication
  [+] convertToTemp outputs to /tmp/ with automatic cleanup after analysis

UI:
  [+] 🍎 emoji added to Finder Services contextual menu item
